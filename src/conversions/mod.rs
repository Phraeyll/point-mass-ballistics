// Terribly inefficient and unsafe/untyped method of unit conversion, only for units needed
// Really need to replace with some form of dimensional analysis.  May be able to use crate 'uom'
// for most conversions, but still need something for termperature.  Also, may need something
// different for arbitrary units, such as those use in air density calculation.  uom has only
// a few common units specified.  May be able to work around at run time.
